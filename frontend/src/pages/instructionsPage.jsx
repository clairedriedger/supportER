                    In psychology, "misery loves company" refers to the tendency
                     for people experiencing negative emotions like sadness or 
                     distress to seek out others who are also experiencing similar 
                     negative emotions, finding some comfort or validation in shared 
                     hardship; essentially, unhappy people may feel better knowing 
                     they aren't alone in their misery, leading them to gravitate 
                     towards others in similar situations.
